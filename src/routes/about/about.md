The portal is aimed at solving the problem of peer to peer feedback of the employees in an organization. In an organization it is important to know about how an employee is performing with its co-workers. The feedback is aimed at reviewing other employees on various scales. It is important to know about how an employee is behaving and working with its co-workers because most of the time when you work in an organization you work in small or big groups. And so for which it is important to know about an employee how he/she is comfortable in working with groups. 

Also the employer must know about itâ€™s best and worst performing employees which helps in promotion of a deserving one or for under performers they can be given scope of improvement to work on their weakness. What we assume and demands for this system to be effective is truthfulness and unbiasedness of the employees towards their co-workers.
